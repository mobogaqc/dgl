## Contributing to DGL

Contribution is always welcomed. A good starting place is the roadmap issue, where
you can find our current milestones. All contributions must go through pull requests
and be reviewed by the committors.

For document improvement, simply PR the change and prepend the title with `[Doc]`.

For new features, we suggest first create an issue using the feature request template.
Follow the template to describe the features you want to implement and your plans.
We also suggest pick the features from the roadmap issue because they are more likely
to be incoporated in the next release.

For bug fix, we suggest first create an issue using the bug report template if the
bug has not been reported yet. Please reply the issue that you'd like to help. Once
the task is assigned, make the change in your fork and PR the codes. Remember to
also refer to the issue where the bug is reported.

Once your PR is merged, congratulation, you are now an contributor to the DGL project.
We will put your name in the list below and also on our [website](https://www.dgl.ai/ack).

Junction Tree VAE - example for training
===

This is a direct modification from https://github.com/wengong-jin/icml18-jtnn

You need to have RDKit installed.

To run the model, use
```
python3 vaetrain_dgl.py
```
The script will automatically download the data, which is the same as the one in the
original repository.
